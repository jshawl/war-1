# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your user stories look great! In the future, it would be nice to see evidence of your planning process, like
a Trello board with current, backlog, and icebox lists and/or unsolved problems / next features to tackle in your readme.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Excellent job branching out and implementing CSS animations! Since we recently learned jQuery, it would
be nice to see you take advantage of that library and reduce the amount of code in your JS, but otherwise great job! A few others
who tackled "war" implemented a "simulate game" feature - can you think of a way to do that with your current code?

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Before submitting a project in the future, please take the time to remove commented out code, remove empty white space, and indent
code correctly. There are a few places where more semantic variable names will increase code readability. Also, try reducing the amount of global
variables in your code base by using functions and/or objects.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**. I recommend leaving comments in your readme about the problems you ran into during this project as well as what features you
might implement in the future. This will be useful for you if/when you revisit this project and when you go into interviews to talk about
your code and what it was like to work on this project.

Overall, great job on project 1!
